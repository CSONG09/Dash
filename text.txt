DASH
The perfect driving buddy

The problem:
Everyday in the US there are over 1,161 injuries and 8 deaths involving crashes that involve a distracted driver.
In 2014, 3,179 people were killed, and 431,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers.
Ten percent of all drivers 15 to 19 years old involved in fatal crashes were reported as distracted at the time of the crashes.
Drivers in their 20s are 23 percent of drivers in all fatal crashes, but are 27 percent of the distracted drivers and 38 percent of the dis­tracted drivers who were using cell phones in fatal crashes.
The percentage of drivers text-messaging or visibly manipu­lating handheld devices increased from 1.7 percent in 2013 to 2.2 percent in 2014.
At any given daylight moment across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving, a number that has held steady since 2010.
Five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting. When traveling at 55mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field blindfolded.

Our solution:
We have designed a hardware/software solution to this issue. The hardware design is inspired by a panda, and it includes an array of camera and infrared sensors along with speakers. It will pair with any bluetooth capable smartphone and will sit in front of the driver to monitor their behavior. This data is synced with the phone app and combined with the data that the app collects like app usage and text messages sent/received to give a comprehensive overview of the driver's behavior when behind the wheel. This data is persisted so the driver can compare more recent scores with older ones to view their progress. There will also be a leaderboards section where the driver can compare their scores with their friends, other drivers in the area, and national data. This is to create a community that inspires better and safer driving habits.
